# Bassie C Compiler
This is a work in progress simple C compiler

It can compile small programs and generate ARM64 or x86_64 assembler which you can assemble with your assembler

For now it only works on macOS ARM64

The features are based on the commits of the amazing [chibicc compiler](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc) commit history
